So i want to make an website that people can upload archives and folders so they can be zipped and unzipped on the server. I then want them to be able to download either the unzipped file or the archive. How do i make this work? Should i use svelte? I want to make sure that the proccessing is donme on the server, so there user can shutdown their pc and let the server do the job and then when they come back then they can download it. I think i wilkl use the 7zip and i want all of its options open to the user. Lastly i want theis app to run in a docker file on anyones home server and work out of the box. :)
